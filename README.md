# Towards Modern Image Manipulation Localization: A Large-Scale Dataset and Novel Methods

### This is the official implementation of the paper Towards Modern Image Manipulation Localization: A Large-Scale Dataset and Novel Methods. <br/>

### The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
* <font size=10>We propose to harness constrained image manipulation models to automatically annotate the numerous unlabelled manually forged images from the web (e.g. those from PhotoShopBattles). Thereby address the severe scarcity of non-synthetic data for image manipulation localization.</font>
* <font size=10>We propose a novel and effective paradigm for constrained image manipulation that significantly improves the accuracy of the automatic annotations. We believe that this is the best paradigm for CIML-based auto-annotation.</font>
* <font size=10>We propose a novel metric to automatically to filter out the possible bad annotations, which is crucial to ensure the quality of an automatically annotated dataset. This metric is quite effective in reflecting the quality of the predictions during the construction of the dataset, where the ground truth is not available.</font>
* <font size=10>Based on the above techniques, we construct a large-scale dataset, termed as MIML, with 123,150 manually forged images and pixel-level annotations denoting the forged regions. The MIML dataset can significantly improve the generalization of different forgery localization models especially on modern-style images.</font> <br/> <br/> <br/>

<font size=10>We are confirmed that large-scale non-synthetic data is very important for deep image manipulation localization models. We hope that our methods and our dataset can shed light on the community and promote the real-world applications of deep image forensic models. </font><br/>


<font size=10>This work is an initial attempt of automatic annotation for IML, futher improvements could be made. We are glad to witnessed the development of this field together with the community. </font><br/>

### The release of the models and codes is ongoing and is expected to be completed within four months. <br/>
